\chapter{Stage Two}

The Hoher Riffler and into the Silvretta.


Stage Two begins with a whimsical conceit: to climb the Hoher Riffler by the
Nordgrat, a real climbing endeavor with significant UIAA grade II and III
terrain. Snow and glacier work seems to be avoidable thanks to the ridge, known
for it’s solid rock. The undertaking from Schnann is significant, involving more
than 2000 meters of elevation gain to the summit, first on road and trail to
Ganatschalpe (1854 m), and then on trail to the Mittagspitze (2635 m). From here
the journey is without trail, there is only the ridge up and over the Gauderkopf
at 2991 meters and thence to the Hoher Riffler at 3168 meters. Descent is to the
southwest to the Edmund Graf Hütte (2375 m) a place for well-deserved rest.

From here, a fantastic journey through high country continues along the
Rifflerweg through the Schmalzgrubenscharte (2697 m) then along the Kieler Weg
to the Sess-See and the Niederelbehütte (2310 m). Crossing the Seßgrat, we climb
to the Obere Fatlarscharte at 2800 meters where the Kieler bivouac box awaits in
case of dire need. The route drops to around 2480 meters before climbing west
again to the Scheidjöchl (2841 m) then dropping for a rest into the upper
Kartelltal with the Darmstädter Hütte (2384 m).

Crossing a small glacier on a northern slope, the track passes through the
Rautejöchl (2752 m) then traverses a high country with permanent snowfields
along the so-called Ludwig Dürr Weg under the summit of the Karkopf to the
Matnaljoch at about 2760 meters elevation. A descent along the ridge to the
Schafbicheljoch, and then a level continuance past various “kopfs” to the
Muttenjoch (2620 m). A short stretch without trail southwest from this pass
appears to easily gain the Grieskopf (2754 m), and then a westward continuation
on the marked ridge terminates at the Fädnerspitze (2788 m), at which point a
direct descent to the Zeinisjoch and the Zeinisjochhaus (1822 m) is gratefully
accomplished.
